It is designed to support a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, providing users with access to powerful computing resources.\n\nIt is particularly useful for tasks that require significant computational power, such as simulations, data analysis, and machine learning.\n\nThis guide provided a basic overview of how to use Gadi for high-performance computing tasks, including accessing the system, running Python scripts, managing dependencies, and monitoring job status.\n\n### 1. Accessing Gadi\n\nTo access Gadi, you need to have an account and SSH access. Use the following command to connect:\n\n```bash\nssh <username>@gadi.nci.org.au\n```\n\nThen, system will prompt you for your password. Once logged in, you can start using the system.\n\n### 2. Gadi Overview\n\nBefore we start using Gadi, let's take a look at some of the key components:\n\n### 3. Usage Example\n\nIn this section, we will run a simple Example to demonstrate how to use run those python scripts needs additional packages.\n\nFirst, go to `/scratch/<project_id>/<username>/` directory:\n\n```bash\ncd /scratch/<project_id>/<username>/\n```\n\nThen, create a new directory(or git clone) for your project:\n\n```bash\nmkdir my_project\ncd my_project\n```\n\nNext, add `python3/3.10.0` to your environment:\n\n```bash\nmodule add python3/3.10.0\n```\n\nNow, you can use `pip` to install `uv`, and use `uv` to create a virtual environment:\n\n```bash\npip3 install uv --user\n```\n\n```bash\nuv venv\n```\n\nAfter that, you can activate the virtual environment:\n\n```bash\nsource venv/bin/activate # directory name may vary\n```\n\nNow, you can install any additional packages you need using `uv pip install`:\n\n```bash\nuv pip install requests\n\n# or\n\nuv pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nWhen you are done, you can deactivate the virtual environment and create a job script to run your Python script on Gadi.\n\n```bash\ndeactivate\n```\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#PBS -P <project_id>\n#PBS -q gpuvolta\n#PBS -l ngpus=0\n#PBS -l ncpus=1\n#PBS -l mem=2GB\n#PBS -l walltime=00:01:00\n#PBS -l wd\n#PBS -l storage=scratch/<project_id>\n\nsource /scratch/<project_id>/<username>/venv/bin/activate\npython3 -c \"import requests; print('requests version:', requests.__version__)\" >> output.txt\n```\n\n```bash\nqsub -P <project_id> job.sh\n```\n\n### 4. Monitoring Your Job\n\nAfter submitting your job, you can monitor its status using the `qstat` command:\n\n```bash\nqstat -u <username>\n```\n\nYou may see below output:\n\n![qstat status Queue](./qstat_q.png)\n\n![qstat status Running](./qstat_r.png)\n\n![qstat status Ended](./qstat_e.png)\n\nThere are three main statuses:\n- **Queue (Q)**: The job is waiting to be scheduled.\n- **Running (R)**: The job is currently running.\n- **Ended (E)**: The job has completed.\n\n### 5. Accessing Output\n\nYou may notice that the output of your job is saved in the `output.txt` file in your project directory. You can view it using:\n\n```bash\ncat output.txt\n# requests version: 2.32.4\n```\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nThis guide provides a basic overview of how to use Gadi for high-performance computing tasks. You can extend this by running more complex scripts, managing dependencies, and optimizing your workflows.","htmlEncrypted":"","nonce":"","timeToRead":null,"title":"Gadi Usage","date":"2025-07-04 23:40:00 +0800","tags":["blog","gadi","high-performance-computing"],"path":"posts/gadi-usage","excerpt":"A practical guide to using Gadi for high-performance computing tasks.","links":[],"commit":0,"type":"posts"}},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/hibana2077.github.io/hibana2077.github.io/content/posts/Gadi Usage/index.mdx"}}},"pageContext":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/hibana2077.github.io/hibana2077.github.io/content/posts/Gadi Usage/index.mdx","postPath":"posts/gadi-usage","translations":[{"hreflang":"en","path":"/posts/gadi-usage"}],"frontmatter":{"title":"Gadi Usage","tags":["blog","gadi","high-performance-computing"],"date":"2025-07-04 23:40:00 +0800","cover":"./preview.png","path":"posts/gadi-usage","excerpt":"A practical guide to using Gadi for high-performance computing tasks."}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1552981879","2158328490","3013679938"],"slicesMap":{}}
