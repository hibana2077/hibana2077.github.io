## Sparse Bayesian Regression in High Dimensions: A Practical Exploration

In this post, we explore how to apply `sklearn.BayesianRidge` to investigate sparsity and uncertainty in high-dimensional regression tasks.

---

### 1. Problem Statement

Suppose we are given a set of high-dimensional feature vectors `a` (from a design matrix `X`) and we aim to perform regression analysis where we not only estimate the coefficients but also quantify their uncertainties (posterior variances). Additionally, we are interested in observing the sparsity characteristics of the model coefficients under different levels of regularization.

The problem can be expressed mathematically as follows.

We observe a design matrix <span>{`$X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$`}</span> and a response vector $$\mathbf y\in\mathbb{R}^n$$ generated by  

<span>{`$$
\mathbf y \;=\; X\,\mathbf w^{\!*} \;+\; \boldsymbol\varepsilon,
\qquad
\boldsymbol\varepsilon \;\sim\; \mathcal N\!\bigl(\mathbf 0,\;\sigma^2 I_n\bigr),
$$`}</span>

where the ground-truth **sparsity vector** <span>{`$$\mathbf w^{\!*}\in\mathbb{R}^d$$`}</span> has only $$s\ll d$$ non-zero entries.

Under the Bayesian-ridge assumption we place a Gaussian prior  

$$
\mathbf w \;\sim\; \mathcal N\!\bigl(\mathbf 0,\;\lambda^{-1} I_d\bigr),
$$

and—in the conjugate-Bayes setting—obtain the Gaussian posterior  

$$
\mathbf w \mid X,\mathbf y
\;\sim\;
\mathcal N\!\bigl(\boldsymbol\mu,\;\Sigma\bigr),
\qquad
\boldsymbol\mu
=\bigl(X^{\!\top}X+\lambda I_d\bigr)^{-1}X^{\!\top}\mathbf y,
\qquad
\Sigma
=\alpha^{-1}\bigl(X^{\!\top}X+\lambda I_d\bigr)^{-1}.
$$

Our goals are:

1. **Coefficient estimation and uncertainty**:  
   study the posterior mean $$\boldsymbol\mu$$ and covariance $$\Sigma$$ to quantify uncertainty.
2. **Sparsity analysis**:  
   examine how the estimated coefficients’ sparsity pattern changes under varying regularisation levels $(\alpha,\lambda)$, and compare it with the true sparsity vector $$\mathbf w^{\!*}.$$

### 2. Synthetic Dataset Generation

To rigorously analyze model behavior, we generate data as follows. Each element of the feature matrix $X$ is sampled from a standard normal distribution $X_{i,j} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$. The true weight vector $w^*$ is constructed by randomly selecting $s$ nonzero elements and setting the rest to zero. The observation noise is sampled as $\varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. Finally, the label vector $y$ is computed as $y = Xw^* + \varepsilon$.

---

### 3. Python Implementation

#### 3.1 Data Generation

> The true weight vector $w^*$ serves as the ground-truth sparsity vector, where only a small subset of coefficients are nonzero.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import BayesianRidge

def generate_synthetic_data(n, d, s, a=1.0, sigma=0.1, random_state=None):
    rng = np.random.default_rng(random_state)
    X = rng.standard_normal(size=(n, d))
    support = rng.choice(d, size=s, replace=False)
    w_true = np.zeros(d)
    w_true[support] = rng.uniform(-a, a, size=s)
    noise = rng.normal(0, sigma, size=n)
    y = X.dot(w_true) + noise
    return X, y, w_true
```

### 4. Analysis

#### 4.1 Threshold Sensitivity Analysis

The relationship between different thresholds $\tau$, the number of estimated nonzero coefficients, precision, and recall is summarized below:

| Threshold $\tau$ | Estimated Nonzero Count | Precision | Recall |
|:---------------:|:------------------------:|:---------:|:------:|
| $1.0\times10^{-2}$ | 782 | 0.023 | 0.900 |
| $3.0\times10^{-2}$ | 404 | 0.042 | 0.850 |
| $5.0\times10^{-2}$ | 177 | 0.085 | 0.750 |
| $7.0\times10^{-2}$ | 66  | 0.197 | 0.650 |

As the threshold increases, the precision improves while the recall declines. A higher precision but lower recall indicates that although fewer false positives occur, more true features are missed.

#### 4.2 Support Recovery Ability

In the generated data, there are 20 true nonzero coefficients. When setting the threshold at $1\times10^{-2}$, the model estimates 782 nonzero coefficients. This result reflects a typical over-selection phenomenon: high recall but extremely low precision.

#### 4.3 Predictive Performance

The model achieves a training $R^2$ score of 1.000 and a testing $R^2$ score of 0.227. The mean squared error (MSE) is 0.006, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.036, and the Pearson correlation between estimated and true coefficients is 0.472. Although the coefficient estimation error is noticeable, the model performs nearly perfectly on the training data. However, the significantly lower testing performance indicates a degree of overfitting.

#### 4.4 Effects of Sample Size and Noise

When the sample-to-feature ratio $n/d$ increases (i.e., more samples relative to features), the number of false positives is expected to decrease. Additionally, increasing the observation noise enlarges the posterior variances, encouraging coefficients to shrink towards zero, thus enhancing sparsity. However, higher noise can also increase the risk of missing true nonzero features.

### 5. Conclusion

Bayesian Ridge regression can effectively recover most important features, achieving high recall. However, it struggles to enforce sparsity naturally, leading to low precision. In high-dimensional sparse problems, although training fit is excellent, the generalization performance is limited, revealing a risk of overfitting. To improve sparsity or generalization ability, one should consider combining feature selection methods such as L1 projection or using models that enforce stronger sparsity priors like ARD (Automatic Relevance Determination). The choice of threshold and the conditions of the data, including sample size and noise level, critically influence the outcomes and should be carefully tuned according to specific application needs.
